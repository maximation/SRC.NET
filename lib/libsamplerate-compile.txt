1. Download and extract source from http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC/download.html

2. Replace Makefile.msvc in Win32 directory with libsamplerate-Makefile.msvc (rename to Makefile.msvc!)
   - This makefile is updated to work with VS2013 whereas the provided makefile was written for the very old Visual Studio .NET and can only compile an x86 version
   - Test programs are not included in this makefile as they do not compile with MSVC (if you need to validate the DLL, compile with gcc instead)

3. Edit the makefile and set MSVCDir to the correct directory

4a. Compile x86 dll in Visual Studio "x86 Native Tools Command Prompt":
    cd to libsamplerate source root folder
    make clean & make

4b. Compile x64 dll in Visual Studio "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt" (or "x64 Cross Tools Command Prompt" on 32 bit Windows):
    cd to libsamplerate source root folder
    make clean & make

Current version used: 0.1.8 / libsamplerate-0.1.8.tar.gz
